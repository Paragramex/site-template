# About

Before I could code my own sites, I was always admiring people's websites and wondering if I could get one for myself. Once I could code and was making my own websites I discovered admin panels. I thought that an admin panel on one of my sites would be cool but I could never integrate an already existing one into my sites. Than I discovered that you could use a .JSON file as a decent DataBase. I decided to create my own admin panel that would edit a .JSON file and the site would read information from the .JSON file and it would write data to a .JSON file so the admin panel will read it.
